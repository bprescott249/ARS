# ARS (Advertisement Recommender System)
ARS is a stand-alone, self-contained system which takes a website's user engagement data as input, and for every page in that website outputs a suggested price for an advertisement. ARS also incorporates an ad-keyword query feature so that a user is able to query the system with keywords related to the product which the user is attempting to advertise, and the ARS suggests pages where that keyword would be relevant.
